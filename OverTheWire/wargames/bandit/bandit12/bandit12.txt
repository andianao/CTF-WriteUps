level goal:
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. 
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. 
Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. 
Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. 
Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

login to bandit12

list available files 

$ ls

view the data.txt
$ cat data.txt


create a unique file name on /tmp
$ mktemp -d

copying the data.txt to /tmp/(new file name created)
$ cp data.txt /tmp/(new file name created)

change working directory to /tmp
$ cd /tmp

rename the (new created file to your like filename)

$ mv (new file name created) recovered

find out the kind of file it is 

$ file recovered

it is hexadecimal in nature by viewing it manually

convert it into binary by xxd command
$ xxd -r recovered > binary

view the file kind of the binary file named binary

$ file binary

it says it is gzip compressed data

first review what and how to use gzip
$ whatis gzip

$ man gzip

then rename the binary file into gzip format

$ mv binary binary.gz

decompress the gzip file

$ gunzip binary.gz

view available files
$ ls

you will see binary file and data.txt

find out again the file kind of binary
$ file binary

it is bzip2 compressed data

$ bunzip2 binary

list files names
$ ls

you will find binary.out

find out file kind of binary.out

$ file binary.out

it is gzip compressed data

then make binary.out into gzip format

$ mv binary.out binary.gz

unzip it

$ gunzip binary.gz

view files again

$ ls

find out what kind of binary file is it now

$ file binary

it is a tar archive file

decompress it by tar command

$ tar -xf binary

view the files names

$ ls

there is data5.bin

find out what is it 

$ file data5.bin

it is tar archive

then repeat the process

$ tar -xf data5.bin

list files
$ ls

oooh there is a data6.bin, find file format then decompress it

$ file data6.bin

it is tar archive

$ tar -xf data6.bin

list files

$ ls

there ther is data8.bin

find file format

$ file data8.bin

it is gzip compressed data

decompress it by using gunzip, but first rename it to gzip format

$ mv data8.bin data8.gz

unzip it

$ gunzip data8.gz  

then view files

$ ls

there is a data8 file, find it's file format

$ file data8

it is an ASCII file (means you can view it by cat in a readable format)

$ cat data8

The password is FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn

use it to log in to the next level bandit13

$ ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

when prompted for password, enter the obtained password above
bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn

did it work?

Congratulations you nailed it :)
