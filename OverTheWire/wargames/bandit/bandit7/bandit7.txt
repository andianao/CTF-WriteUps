level goal:
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt 
next to the word millionth

login to bandit7 by using the password from the bandit6

once loged in

run
$ ls

you will find a file called data.txt and this is what we want

run the command to see the contents of it

$ cat data.txt

but the file it is too long with many usernames and their possibly responsible passwords

run

$ cat data.txt | grep bandit8

it results to none

then try again for only bandit

$ cat data.txt | grep bandit

there results to 6 passwords of interests 

lets try one by one manualy ( but this is  not the best way to do it, but for now its better trying them)

bandit	MFa7k86ULwUJ8ZsVZJyq4E0XBCVEu7ck
banditti	79V6VSFIXwpATtq2A2IXaIlG7EtajBDL
bandits	HusX2CTUZSike5GzdL1eWNUrvpkaVPYr
banditry	y2muCYRokuPG7LL8htGrQnwjHixgB2XL
banditry's	opE3V3IoxrJk0x2wqRt7CL5TUlUtpE1Q
bandit's	N3dCkVYPAXHn8mv9VnREnaaOQrdC9ika

all of them refused to grant us access to bandit8 

> This means we are totaly wrong, ( it's part of learning also )

from the instructions it says the password is next to millionth word
( meaning it is just next to it, so find exactly the word "millionth" without the "" and get the password next to it)

run

$ cat data.txt | grep millionth

it results to

 millionth	dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

then	dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc is our password to login to bandit8
