ðŸ”¹ Bandit Level 13 â†’ Level 14

ðŸ”¹ Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. 
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. 
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

ðŸ”¹ Commands you may need to solve this level

ðŸ”¹ ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap


ðŸ”¹ Helpful Reading Material

    SSH/OpenSSH/Keys (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys)


Plan
Since the password is owned by the user bandit14,
and we login by using user bandit13.
what we have is only sshkey.private which we can view it's contents,
then that is good for us.

Hence the trick is to copy the sshkey.private to our local machine and name it whatever we like
but for this case i choose to use the same name as sshkey.private

$ cat sshkey.private

copy its contents manually to your local machine and save it as sshkey.private

From now onwards on your local machine run the following commands


$ shh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Syntax for the above command: ssh -i <ssh-file-name> <username>@<hostname> (write without the < >)

then you are supposed to be in bandit14 without being asked for password
if not then there is something wrong you did. 
please review your previous steps


since all of the passwords are stored on /etc/bandit_pass/
now lets find the password for bandit14
it will be stored on /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14


run the following command
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

Voila! and the password is
MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

Verification

let's use the password to login to bandit14 (without using the ssh key but the password only)

run the following command

$ ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

and when prompted for password enter: MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

Congratulations you nailed it ..... :)
