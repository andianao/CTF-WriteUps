level goal: The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

run the following commands

$ ls

$ find / -type f -size 33c | grep bandit6

observe the greped output for bandit6

you will see something of interesting at path /etc/bandit_pass/bandit6

run the following command

$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit6

the password will be displayed

but this password doesnt work to login for the bandit7
because the above password is for bandit6 login 

so let's dig deeper to find password for bandit7

let's modify the previous command to grep the bandit7 instead of bandit6
$ find / -type f -size 33c | grep bandit7

there are 2 outputs of interests 
1. output at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit7

run 
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit7

it results to permision denied ( it is because of ... )

2. output of interest

at /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

run 

$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

and it will spawns a password

Congrats you did it .....
