Run the password by logging into bandit7

Does it run?

Well, this password doesnt work to login for the bandit7
because the above password is for bandit6 login 

so let's dig deeper to find password for bandit7

let's modify the previous command to grep the bandit7 instead of bandit6
$ find / -type f -size 33c | grep bandit7

there are 2 outputs of interests 
1. output of interest at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit7

run cat command to display the file components
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit7

it results to permision denied ( it is because of ... )

2. output of interest

at /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

run cat command to display the output of the file

$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

and it will spawns a password
