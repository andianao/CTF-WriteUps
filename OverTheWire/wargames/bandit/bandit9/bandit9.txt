more detailed steps 
Step 1: Extract human-readable strings

Use strings to pull out only printable (readable) text from the file:

strings data.txt

This filters out binary garbage and shows you readable content.
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Filter only lines with = before the text

Use grep to find lines where the readable string is preceded by many =:

strings data.txt | grep -E '^=+'

This command:

    strings data.txt â†’ extracts human-readable strings.

    grep -E '^=+' â†’ matches lines that start with one or more = signs.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: (Optional) Extract only the string after the = signs

strings data.txt | grep -oP '^=+\K.*'

    ^=+ â†’ start of line, multiple =

    \K â†’ discard everything before this

    .* â†’ capture the rest of the line
